NumExt
======

### NumExt is NO LONGER MAINTAINED since April 2010

One of my first firefox addons - it started as a need to number tabs for use with Vimperator back in 2010, before the support was added in Vimperator itself - then it grew with many silly to weird features :-) - even though it is no longer maintainer, it is still in use by 1k+ users daily!
