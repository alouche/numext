{"name":"NumExt - Numbered Tabs","tagline":"NumExt numbers your tabs with no limitation as to how many tabs you can open. (NumExt is NO LONGER MAINTAINED since April 2010)","body":"# Quick Guide\r\n## ShortCuts (keys)\r\n\r\n### ALT + X\r\nwill open a small box in the right corner of the status bar.. in which NumExt commands can be entered\r\n\r\n> As in version 0.6, a NumExt clickable label has been inserted under the Tools menu of the main menu. In case Alt + X is used by another addon or menu, you can set up a shortcut key by typing (execkey z) for \"Alt + z\". The clickable \"NumExt (exec)\" enables the command box as in the shortcut key.\r\n\r\n### ALT + 1\r\nump to tab number 9\r\n### ALT + 2\r\nwill jump to tab number 10 ... so on till till ALT + 9 (which jumps to tab number 17)\r\n\r\n> (the ALT + [number] shortcuts were created as to go over Firefox limits of AccessKeys Control to tab from 1 to 8 || This HACK only works on Windows OS based systems)\r\n\r\n## help\r\nThe help command will display this how to in case you need to look up something\r\n\r\n## update\r\nThe update command will notify you wether or not, you are using the lastest version of NumExt\r\n\r\n## [number]\r\nThe [number] command just mean, you can type any tab numbers such as \"1\" or \"2\" (without the \"\") and you will jump straight to the tab with this number.\r\n\r\n## open\r\nThe open command is used as follow \"open Site_URL\" for example \"open http://google.fr\" - this will therefore automatically create a new tab and open google.fr\r\n\r\n## hide\r\nIn version 0.5 - you can now type (hide 1) to only hide tab number 1... Typing \"hide\" with no numbers will hide all tabs\r\n\r\n> The hide command, will hide all your open tabs.. It will not close them, just hide them, so your work is still saved!\r\n\r\n## show\r\nIn version 0.5 - you can now type (show 1) to restore tab number 1 (if hidden before)... Typing \"show\" with no numbers will restore all tabs (if hidden as well).\r\n\r\nThe show command, will \"un-hide\" (related to the hide command) the hidden tabs, restoring them.\r\n\r\n## title\r\nThe title command, will change the title of the page selected, (title 2 My Page is cool).\r\n\r\n> In version 0.6 - you can now type (title My Page is cool) to change the title page of the current tab.\r\n\r\n## col\r\nThe col command is used with different arguments... is here is the possible combination\r\n\r\n* col [number] title [color name] - will change the title color of the tab selected (example: col 3 title blue)\r\n* col [number] [color name] - will change the background color of the tab selected (example: col 3 red)\r\n* col [color name] - will change the background color of the tab on which you currently are (example: col aqua)\r\n* col title [color name] - will change the title's color of the tab on which you currently are(example: col title azure)\r\n* col alias {a - e} [color name] - NumExt 0.4 ships with 5 alias slot for you to save your favorite color for easy access by using short cuts such as a, b, c, d, and e. For instance, instead of typing (col AntiqueWhite), you can save \"AntiqueWhite\" in the alias slot \"a\" and just type \"col a\". To register \"AntiqueWhite\" in slot a, type (col alias a AntiqueWhite), do the same for b with another color etc... till e.\r\n\r\n> KEEP in mind, that [color name] can be a normal color name or simply an hexa color value such as #FF0045. For a list of all colors you can use, refer to http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp (be creative)\r\n\r\n## nocol\r\nThe nocol command, will \"reset\" the colors of the tab to your default theme. For exmaple to reset the color of tab 3, type \"nocol 3\" or simply \"nocol\" for the tab on which you currently are.\r\n\r\n## reload\r\nYou are on tab 15 and need to reload tab 10, type in \"reload 10\" and voila.. without switching tabs, remote reload.\r\n\r\n## num\r\nNumbers your tab if disabled earlier with command \"nonum\"\r\n\r\n## nonum\r\nAnnoyed but the numberings, or do not need it for fewer tabs, but still want to use the NumExt commands, just type \"nonum\"\r\n\r\n## execkey\r\nCan't use \"Alt + X\" shortcut key, no problem, type execkey \"LETTER\" as in (execkey Z) to use Alt + Z etc...\r\n\r\n## sep\r\n\"sep #\" will change your default numbering to \"1# 2# 3# etc...\", you are free to use other carachters such as \"' . % Â¨\" etc...\r\n\r\n## assist\r\n(only in 0.7) \"assist on\" turns a Command parser assistant.. \"assist off\" will disable it\r\n\r\n## close\r\nThe \"close\" command is entered with no arguments, will close the current selected tab. \"close ID\" (ID being a tab number) will close the corresponding tab number.\r\n\r\n> (only in 0.7) It is now possible to close a range of tabs, so to close tab 1 to tab 10, just type \"close 1:10\".. To close many tabs that are not in range as in tab 1, tab4, tab 10, type \"close 1 4 10\" ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
